## Introduction 

This project is created by: Matt Corsetti

This is the frontend for The Healing Hand website that I am developing.

## Instructions

### Getting Started 

The first thing you will need is a IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), or whatever your IDE of choice is. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

The tech stack for this project is the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) + ApolloServer-GraphQL stack so experience in this tech stack is recommended. However, I am no where near an expert in this tech stack, and it is a lot of fun to learn about so I highly recommend giving it a chance. 

### Building and Running the Project  

You will need the following versions of the technologies: 

React: 16.12.0
npm: 6.13.1
Node.js: 13.9.0 
JavaScript: ES6

In order to get this project running on your own device, the first thing you should do is clone this repo. 
https://github.com/Matt-Corsetti/the-healing-hand-ui.git

Once you have cloned the repo to your own device, I would cd to the location you cloned the folder to and run the following command to ensure all the node modules and depencies get installed on the project: npm install.

Lastly, when you are finished installing all the node modules and depencies you should be able to run the start command "npm start" and the application will be up and running in just a couple of minutes. 

## More Details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
